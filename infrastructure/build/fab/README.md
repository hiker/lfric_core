# LFRic Core Fab Build Scripts

Make sure you have Fab version 2.0.1 or later installed (in addition to all
LFRic core requirements of course).

## Setting up Site- and Platform-specific Settings
Site- and platform-specific settings are contained in 
```$LFRIC_CORE/infrastructure/build/site-specific/${SITE}-${PLATFORM}```
The default settings are in ```.../site-specific/default``` (and at this
stage each other site-specific setup inherits the values set in the default,
and then adds or modifies settings). The Fab build system provides various
callbacks to the ```config.py``` file in the corresponding directory (details
are in the [Fab documentation](https://metoffice.github.io/fab/fab_base/config.html).

If there is no existing site-specific setup, it is recommended to copy an existing
configuration file (e.g. from ```nci_gadi/config.py```). This act as a template
to indicate where you can specify linker information, select a default compiler
suite etc.

The default setup contains compiler flags for Cray, GNU, Intel-classic (ifort),
Intel-LLVM (ifx), and NVIDIA. For modularity's sake (and to keep the file length
shorter), the default configuration will get the settings from the corresponding
```setup_...py``` script. There is no need for a site to replicate this structure,
existing ```config.py``` scripts show how this can be done.


## Setting up PYTHONPATH
Many (if not all) PSyclone scripts use a library of convenience functions located in
```$LFRIC_CORE/infrastructure/build/psyclone/psyclone_tools.py```. In order to be
able to import these functions, the path ```$LFRIC_CORE/infrastructure/build/psyclone```
must be added to your ```$PYTHONPATH```, e.g.:
```
export PYTHONPATH=$LFRIC_CORE/infrastructure/build/psyclone:$PYTHONPATH
```

## Building the Skeleton Apps

In order to build the skeleton apps, change into the directory
```$LFRIC_CORE/applications/skeleton```,
and use the following command:

```
./fab_skeleton.py --nprocs 4 --site nci --platform gadi  --suite intel-classic
```
Select an appropriate number of processes to run in parallel, and your site and platform.
If you don't have a default compiler suite in your site-specific setup (or
want to use a non-default suite), use the ``--suite`` option. Once the process is finished,
you should have a binary in the directory
```./fab-workspace/skeleton-full-debug-COMPILER``` (where ```COMPILER``` is the compiler
used, e.g. ```mpif90-gfortran```).

Using ```./fab_skeleton.py -h``` will show a help message with all supported command line
options (and their default value). If a default value is listed using an environment
variables (```(default: $SITE or 'default')```), the corresponding environment variable
is used if no command line option has been specified.

A different compilation profile can be specified using ```--profile``` option. Note
that the available compilation profiles can vary from site to site (see
[Fab documentation](https://metoffice.github.io/fab/fab_base/config.html) for details).

If Fab has issues finding a compiler, you can use the Fab debug option
```--available-compilers```, which will list all compilers and linkers Fab has
identified as being available.
